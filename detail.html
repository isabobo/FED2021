<h2>How Channel Affairs adds value</h2>
<p>To better understand the client’s challenges, we interviewed and spent time with several Amplifon audiologists. This enabled us to evaluate possible solutions and determine the best way to collect customer information. Channel Affairs then designed and built a customer engagement solution to help audiologists manage this complex process. The solution also made it easier for customers to quickly process the information the audiologist was sharing. We also worked closely with Amplifon to optimise the internal collaboration between countries.</p>
</div>

<h2>How Amplifon benefits</h2>
<p>Audiologists in more than 10 Amplifon countries are already using our solution.  It’s now easier for customers to process this complex information and make informed decisions. As a result, sales and ASP have increased significantly, since customers are clear on what is needed for their health and what solution suits their needs. Amplifon has also been able to optimize the internal collaboration.</p>
