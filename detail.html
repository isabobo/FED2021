<h2>The case of Amplifon</h2>
<h1>Improve engagement, boost customer sales</h1>

<p id="quotesSlide">"Working on an IT project often requires flexibility and user-oriented mindset to get the best solution for customers. Channel Affairs has provided our company with a unique combination of business insights, innovation with their products and flawless translation of high-level requirements into meaningful business solutions" </p>
<p>Gabriele Sanguigno (Product Manager) National Health Care Amplifon Australia</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>With over 10 million customers, Amplifon is the world's largest hearing aid retailer. They empower people to re-discover the emotions of sound. Amplifon offers hearing aid products and services in 22 countries.</p>

<h2>Challenges facing Amplifon</h2>
<p>As part of their strategy, Amplifon wanted a digital solution to strengthen their in-shop experience. To help customers make informed decisions, their audiologists needed to share complex information with them about hearing tests, insurance, the hearing aid and care options. Creating a unified solution is complicated because each country has its own legal, health and insurance requirements. </p>

<h2>How Channel Affairs adds value</h2>
<p>To better understand the client’s challenges, we interviewed and spent time with several Amplifon audiologists. This enabled us to evaluate possible solutions and determine the best way to collect customer information. Channel Affairs then designed and built a customer engagement solution to help audiologists manage this complex process. The solution also made it easier for customers to quickly process the information the audiologist was sharing. We also worked closely with Amplifon to optimise the internal collaboration between countries.</p>

<h2>How Amplifon benefits</h2>
<p>Audiologists in more than 10 Amplifon countries are already using our solution.  It’s now easier for customers to process this complex information and make informed decisions. As a result, sales and ASP have increased significantly, since customers are clear on what is needed for their health and what solution suits their needs. Amplifon has also been able to optimize the internal collaboration.</p>
